## üìñ Overview  
This project aims to predict stock prices based on historical data. By using sequential models such as RNN, LSTM, and GRU, the system generates predictions for future stock values. This project is designed to help explore the power of deep learning in time series forecasting.

## üåü Features  
- Data fetching from Yahoo Finance using `yfinance`.  
- Scalable preprocessing pipeline with `MinMaxScaler`.  
- Sequence generation for time series modeling.  
- Implementation of **RNN**, **LSTM**, and **GRU** models with TensorFlow.  
- Model checkpointing and early stopping for optimal performance.  
- Visualizations for actual vs. predicted stock prices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation  
1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   https://github.com/MohamadPirniakan/Stock_price_prediction.git
   cd StockPricePrediction
   ```  

2. **Install dependencies**:  
   Ensure you have Python 3.8 or above installed, then run:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

3. **Run the script**:  
   Execute the main script to start training models and generating predictions:  
   ```bash
   StockPricePrediction.ipynb
   ```  

---

## üöÄ Usage  
- Modify the `stock_symbol`, `start_date`, and `end_date` in the script to work with different stocks or timeframes.  
- Check the `models/` folder for saved models after training.  
- View the generated logs in the `logs/training.log` file.
